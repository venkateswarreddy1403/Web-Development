=> Bootstrap is a free, open-source framework that helps web developers 
    create websites and web apps more quickly and efficiently

=>Bootstrap provides developers with a suite of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that 
    contain reusable page elements, styles, and interactions. 
    This means that building a website is much faster using Bootstrap than designing and coding 
    common UI elements from scratch.

=>Bootstrap provides us with many predefined class names. Some of them are:
card
carousel
alert
alert-success
alert-link
bg-danger
card-body and many more...
